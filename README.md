Company Background
AIT Research (AITR) is a market research company that allows people from the general public to register
their personal details, buying habits etc. with AITR, and then sends these respondents to market research
jobs, based on the needs of AITR’s clients.
AITR asks respondents to email their details and maintains these manual emails. To find all respondents
who match the client’s needs, staff at AITR look through the emails to find respondents who match the
criteria – for example, Males between the ages of 24 to 29 who are using ANZ bank, interested in Horse
Racing Sport and Asia travel. Or, Females who use Westpac as one of their banks.
AITR wants to move to a web-based system where respondents can register their details online, and staff
can then search through these registrations to find respondents who match the requested criteria.

●
The user interface for respondents and staff should be Web-based
